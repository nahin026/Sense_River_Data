This repository contains supplementary data associated with the manuscript:
“Assessing Flood-Influenced Sediment Dynamics Using UAV Photogrammetry and Machine Learning: Insights from River Sense, Switzerland.” submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (ESurf), 2025.
File: grain_size_data.zip — Grain size measurements extracted from sediment surface images using ImageGrains.
Grain size data were derived from high-resolution images of river bar surfaces using the ImageGrains automated grain size analysis tool.
Each dataset represents an individual sampling location. The corresponding spatial data (in .kml format) provide site coordinates and sample identifiers for cross-reference with the grain size data.
